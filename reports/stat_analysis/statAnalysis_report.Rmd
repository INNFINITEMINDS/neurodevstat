abstract: |
  We provide an analytical plan to evaluate the effects of performing gene
  knockouts in yeast using CRISPR biotechnology. The methods presented rely on
  fewer assumptions than are inherent in (competing) methods that rely on the
  Negative Binomial family of distributions. In particular, we use the "voom"
  method of the popular linear modeling R package
  [`Limma`](http://www.statsci.org/smyth/pubs/limma-biocbook-reprint.pdf) to
  model the mean-variance relationship rather than raw read counts, providing a
  way to detect differential expression while preserving asymptotically correct
  statistical inference.
